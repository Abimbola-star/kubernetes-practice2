## The Service

Since pods are ephemeral (can be created and destroyed at any moment), their IP addresses cannot be relied on for communication, thatâ€™s where the service resource comes in the picture. Service provides a single IP address and port for a set of Pods, it can load-balance across them and do health checks.

### Expose a pod or a deployment using a service
To define a pod and expose it using a service, the label of the pod must match the selector of the service.
Example: check the `service-pod-def.yaml` and `service-deployment-def.yaml`

### Types of Service

- **ClusterIP (default)**
    - use case: Internal communication between Pods
    - Accessible from: Inside the cluster only
    - Load Balancer: No

- **NodePort**
    - use case: Exposes a service on a static port on each node
    - Accessible from: Outside the cluster via <Node-IP>:<port>
    - Load Balancer: No

- **Loadbalancer**
    - use case: Exposes service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer
    - Accessible from: Internet (External IP)
    - Load Balancer: yes

- **ExternalName**
    - use case: Maps a service to an external DNS name
    - Accessible from: Outside the cluster
    - Load Balancer: No
